# Getting And Cleaning Data - Course Project

## Introduction

This repo contains my course project to [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) ["Getting And Cleaning Data"](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-031) course that is part of [Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage) specialization.

There is just one script called `run_analysis.R`. It contains all functions and code to do the following:

1. Read the training and test data  
2. Do the required transformations to create a tidy dataset
3. Write output data to a CSV file inside `data/output` dir

The `CodeBook.md` explains it more detailed.


## Run from command line

1. Clone this repo
2. Make sure that all the required source files are downloaded and kept in folder named "Project". Details in CodeBook.
3. Run the script:

       > run_analysis.R

4. Look for the final dataset at `data/output/uci_har_mean_std_averages.csv`

## Open project with RStudio
